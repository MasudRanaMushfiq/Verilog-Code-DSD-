"# Verilog-Code-DSD-" 
# Verilog Project â€“ Digital System Design

## Overview

This project implements a digital system using Verilog HDL as part of the Digital System Design course. The Verilog code models combinational and/or sequential logic circuits with an emphasis on synthesizable, modular design. It demonstrates fundamental hardware design concepts and provides practical experience in digital logic implementation.

## Features

- Written in synthesizable Verilog  
- Modular and reusable components  
- Designed to meet timing and functional correctness  
- Includes simulation for verification of logic behavior
